# planet_earth
This is just a practice website. The first of my websites to have been initialised from GitBash so that all changes are tracked. 
I will make updates to the site to practice CSS and maybe even JS functionality. I will then push these changes form the GitBash command line.
I have now added JavaScript functionality (which I originally wrote in Python and got AI to help me refactor into JS) to order a coffee through a coffee bot. I plan to update this so the default 'this page says' doesn't show and custom styling is added instead.
